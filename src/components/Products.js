import React, { useContext } from 'react';
// STEP 4 - Consuming data with ProductContext
// Now that our ProductContext is now providing data we can finally consume it! To do so let's head over to our Products component and import the useContext hook as well as our ProductContext.
import Product from './Product';
import { ProductContext } from '../contexts/ProductContext';

// In the component, call the useContext hook and pass in the context object we want to use into it.
// When we do this, useContext is going to return value passed by our ProductContext Provider value prop. In our case we're getting back an object with two properties. A products property and an addItem property. We can go ahead and destructure those.


const Products = () => {
	const {products, addItem} = useContext(ProductContext);
	
	// Now that we have all of the data we need we can refactor our Products component from using props.
	// To do so we just need to remove every instance of props.
	// Remove it from the function parameters, products map and addItem.
	// Components

	return (
		<div className="products-container">
			{products.map(product => (
				<Product
					key={product.id}
					product={product}
					addItem={addItem}
				/>
			))}
		</div>
	);
};
// Now our Products component is getting it's data solely from Context API ðŸ˜ƒ.
export default Products;
